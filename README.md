# Pendulum
who cares  
This program displays a pendulum that swings around. That's all. Why did you even want this?

# Compilation
Visual Studio is required, or at the very least a C# compiler with SFML.Net installed.
1. Create a new project. (Make sure it is set to use .Net Core 5.0, not .Net Framework)
2. Install SFML.Net via NuGet or whatever method you prefer.
3. Copy all the files into the project directory.
4. Build the project (via F6 on Visual Studio)
5. Copy OpenSans-VariableFont.ttf into the directory where your EXE file was put.
6. Run. Hopefully it should work, I don't know.
